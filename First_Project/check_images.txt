Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: Not all of them managed to classify the breed correctly. VGG and ResNet did so, but AlexNet missclassified the image of a French Bulldog, as a Brabancon Griffon.


2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: None of the three model managed to correctly classify Dog_02.jpg. For AlexNet it was a muzzle (which is a dog), for VGG it was a hartebeest (which is NOT a dog), and ResNet classified it as an arabian camel, dromedary (which is obviously not a dog either). In this case, I would say certainly say that the best performance was for AlexNet model. 


3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: The three of the models managed to correctly classify the Cat_01.jpg and Stanley_thermos_01.jpg images to not be dogs. 


4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer: I consider the ResNet to be the best model since it had correctly classified the images and the dogÂ´s breed. The results are very similar for those of VGG regarding classification, but the ResNet model took half of the time VGG took, 0:0:4 vs 0:0:8. It may not be a big difference now, but it's due to being a small amount of images to classify. This could become a potential issue when presented a larger dataset.
