# First Project 
## Project Description
In this project, I used an existing image classifier model to identify dog breeds. 

## Context
In this hypothetical context, I had to contribute to the organization of a citywide dog show. My role involved assisting the organizing committee with contestant registration. To ensure the integrity of the competition, I needed to verify that every participant registering for the dog show was, in fact, registering a real dog and not another type of pet.

To achieve this, an existing Python classifier was implemented. This classifier was designed to analyze images submitted during registration and determine whether the registered pet was indeed a dog. If the classifier confirmed that the pet was a dog, the registration process continued. However, if the classifier detected that the pet was not a dog, it prompted the organizers to review the registration.

This project demonstrated the practical application of machine learning and image classification in real-world scenarios, showcasing how technology can be used to enhance event organization and decision-making processes.

## Principal Objectives
* Correctly identify which pet images are of dogs (even if the breed is misclassified) and which pet images aren't of dogs.
* Correctly classify the breed of dog, for the images that are of dogs.
* Determine which CNN model architecture (ResNet, AlexNet, or VGG), "best" achieve objectives 1 and 2.
* Consider the time resources required to best achieve objectives 1 and 2, and determine if an alternative solution would have given a "good enough" result, given the amount of time each of the algorithms takes to run.
